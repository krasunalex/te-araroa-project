                        <p>I enjoy building practical tools that solve real problems. My career has been about helping organizations understand and use data in meaningful ways.</p>
                        <p>As a Founding AI Engineer and former agency co-founder, I've had the chance to lead the development of custom AI agents for businesses in various industries.</p>
                        <p>I'm also fascinated by the stories data can tell. In a past role as a Data Scientist at Onex, I built dashboards to turn complex data into clear insights and used AI to improve data interpretation.</p>
                        <p>My technical skills include the tools needed to see this project through, like Python, TensorFlow, and GIS software such as ESRI ArcGIS.</p>

                        <p>My passion for the outdoors has taken me to some incredible places, from multi-day treks in the Canadian Rockies and Austrian Alps to the trails of Norway.</p>
                        <p>Hiking is more than a hobby for me; it's a practice of observation and resilience. It's this mindset—of paying close attention to the environment and working through challenges—that I will bring to this data collection effort.</p>
                        <p>For me, the Te Araroa hike is more than an adventure. It's an opportunity to use my skills in a meaningful way, contributing to the stewardship of the places that inspire me.</p>
