                        <p>I enjoy building practical tools that solve real problems. My career has been about helping organizations understand and use data in meaningful ways.</p>
                        <p>As a Founding AI Engineer and former agency co-founder, I've had the chance to lead the development of custom AI agents for businesses in various industries.</p>
                        <p>I'm also fascinated by the stories data can tell. In a past role as a Data Scientist at Onex, I built dashboards to turn complex data into clear insights and used AI to improve data interpretation.</p>
                        <p>My technical skills include the tools needed to see this project through, like Python, TensorFlow, and GIS software such as ESRI ArcGIS.</p>

                        <h3>Why I Hike</h3>
                        <p>My passion for the outdoors has taken me to some incredible places, from multi-day treks in the Canadian Rockies and Austrian Alps to the trails of Norway.</p>
                        <p>Hiking is more than a hobby for me; it's a practice of observation and resilience. It's this mindset—of paying close attention to the environment and working through challenges—that I will bring to this data collection effort.</p>
                        <p>For me, the Te Araroa hike is more than an adventure. It's an opportunity to use my skills in a meaningful way, contributing to the stewardship of the places that inspire me.</p>

                    <div class="track-content">
                        <p>🌍 This flagship proposal is designed to transform trail management from a reactive process to a proactive, data-driven strategy. This track is ideal for Trail Management Organizations, GIS/Mapping Tech Companies, and technology firms with initiatives focused on environmental and social impact.</p>

                            <h4>The Project:</h4>
                            <p>This initiative involves systematically collecting high-resolution, geotagged data on trail degradation points—such as erosion, treefall, and infrastructure damage —along the entire 3,000km route. In the post-hike phase, this unique dataset will be used to train a machine learning model to predict future maintenance "hotspots" before they become critical failures.</p>

                                <li><strong>🔧 Enable Proactive Maintenance:</strong> Move beyond anecdotal reports. The predictive model enables a data-driven maintenance schedule, allowing your organization to allocate limited budgets and volunteer hours with maximum efficiency to build a more resilient trail.</li>
                                <li><strong>🗺️ Gain a Unique Ground-Truth Dataset:</strong> This project provides the most comprehensive trail condition dataset ever created for the Te Araroa. This data can be used to validate and enrich your existing maps or create a new premium "Verified Condition" layer, enhancing user safety and planning.</li>
                                <li><strong>📊 Receive Actionable Analytical Tools:</strong> This partnership delivers more than raw data. Key deliverables include a full analytical report and an interactive "Risk Model" map that visually highlights trail sections the model identifies as likely to degrade under specific conditions, such as after heavy rainfall.</li>

                                <li><strong>Identify Precise Failure Points:</strong> The 3,000km duration is the ultimate stress test. The analysis can pinpoint the exact wear patterns and failure points of packs, footwear, and apparel, allowing you to engineer even more durable products that strengthen your brand promise and sustainability goals.</li>
                                <li><strong>Unparalleled Test Duration & Conditions:</strong> This dataset offers a depth and duration that far exceeds what can be achieved in a lab or through short-term ambassador testing. You receive a final analytical report detailing the findings, complete with visual evidence, to gain a true competitive edge.</li>
