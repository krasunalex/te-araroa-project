**(Slide 2: The Opportunity)**

### **Validating Durability & Sustainability with Real-World Data**

Lab tests and short-term feedback are valuable, but they cannot fully replicate the cumulative stress of a long-distance expedition. This creates a gap between controlled testing and how products truly perform and endure over their lifetime.

This project closes that gap. A **five-month, 3,000 km thru-hike** provides an unparalleled R&D environment to collect objective, long-term data on material degradation, validating the core principles of durability and circularity your brand is built on.

**(Slide 3: The Project)**

### **A 5-Month Field Test on the Te Araroa**

This project reframes a thru-hike as a structured, data-collection deployment on New Zealand's Te Araroa trail.

The Te Araroa is the ultimate testing ground, spanning multiple climate zones—from subtropical forests and rugged coastlines to exposed alpine passes.

As a field data scientist and AI engineer, I will systematically collect and analyze performance data on a full suite of your gear across this entire journey, providing insights relevant to your global customer base.

**(Slide 4: The Methodology)**

### **From Subjective Feedback to Quantitative Analysis**

This project moves beyond opinion to provide objective, actionable data.

  * **Systematic Data Capture:** Standardized daily logs and high-resolution photography will be used to track wear patterns at key stress points (e.g., shoulder straps, seams, high-abrasion zones).
  * **Quantitative Metrics:** The analysis will focus on objective performance indicators, including DWR degradation, insulation loft loss, and fabric durability.
  * **Circularity & Durability Assessment:** The methodology is designed to identify specific wear patterns and failure points, providing direct insights to inform design for longevity and repairability.

**(Slide 5: The Value Proposition)**

### **Actionable Insights for Your R&D and Sustainability Teams**

This partnership is designed to deliver a direct return on investment to your product teams.

  * **Data-Driven R&D:** Provide your R&D team with hard data to validate design choices, test new materials, and identify specific opportunities for innovation.
  * **Validate Durability & Circularity Goals:** Pinpoint exact failure modes to engineer more durable products, reinforcing your brand's lifetime warranties and circularity goals by designing out waste.
  * **Provide Data for LCA & Science-Based Targets:** Collect a unique, long-term dataset on material degradation that can feed directly into your Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) models and support your science-based targets.

**(Slide 6: The Deliverables)**

### **What Your Team Receives**

1.  **The Complete Performance Dataset:** The full, structured raw dataset containing all metrics, logs, and observations collected during the 5-month expedition.
2.  **Final Analytical Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, data visualizations, an analysis of wear patterns and failure points, and actionable recommendations for your product teams.
3.  **High-Quality Visual Assets:** A professional portfolio of high-resolution photos and videos showing your gear performing in the diverse and challenging landscapes of New Zealand.
4.  **Confidentiality & Exclusivity:** All data and findings from the analysis will be confidential and the exclusive property of your brand.

**(Slide 7: About the Researcher)**

### **The AI Engineer in the Field**

I bring a unique combination of technical data science skills and proven backcountry resilience.

  * **AI & Data Expertise:** As a Founding AI Engineer and former Data Scientist, I have extensive experience building analytical tools and extracting insights from complex datasets using Python, TensorFlow, and other machine learning frameworks.
  * **Backcountry Experience:** I am an experienced thru-hiker with the physical and mental fortitude to execute a self-sufficient, 5-month field deployment, having completed multi-day treks in demanding environments like the Canadian Rockies and the Austrian Alps.

**(Slide 8: Partnership & Budget)**

### **Investment for a 7-Month R&D Project**

This is a proposal for a professional 7-month technology project (5 months field, 2 months analysis) with a total operational budget of **$33,500 CAD**.

  * **On-Trail Stipend (5 months):** $12,500
  * **Professional Fee (2 months Post-Hike Analysis):** $15,000
  * **Project Hard Costs (Flights, Insurance, Tech):** $6,000

We offer several partnership tiers and are open to discussing bespoke arrangements:

  * **Title Sponsor:** $38,000
  * **Gear & Services Sponsor (Value-in-Kind + Cash):** A combination of essential equipment and a cash contribution to cover hard costs.
