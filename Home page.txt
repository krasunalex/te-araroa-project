Purpose and Audience
Yes, the goal of this website is to be the single, professional hub for all potential sponsors. Think of it as a digital brochure or the landing page for the entire operation. It needs to be broad enough to capture the interest of a tech company, a conservation group, and an outdoor brand simultaneously. It establishes the project's credibility before you even send a detailed pitch deck.


Handling the Three Pitches
You're right to question how to present the three different pitches on one site. The key is to frame them as different applications of one core project.

The website's main story isn't about three separate ideas; it's about one unified project: 

The Trail AI Intelligence Project. This project has a core capability—collecting high-quality data over 3,000 km and analyzing it with AI. You then offer potential partners three specific ways they can leverage this capability.

Your website will present the overall vision first, and then have a dedicated section that outlines these three "Partnership Tracks." When you email a specific company, you'll send them to the main website but call their attention to the track most relevant to them.

Website Sections 
Here is a recommended structure for a clean, effective one-page scrolling website. This presents you as a professional project manager, not just a hiker.

1. Hero Section (The Hook)

Project Title: The Trail AI Intelligence Project: Te Araroa 

Tagline: A 3,000km field research initiative to generate high-value datasets for conservation, trail management, and product innovation.

Call to Action Button: "View Partnership Opportunities" (links down to the Partnership Tracks section).

2. Project Vision (The "What & Why")

A short, compelling paragraph explaining the mission.

Frame the hike as a professional "Hiker-in-Residence" or "Field AI Researcher" deployment. Explain you're turning the Te Araroa trail into a 4-month-long outdoor laboratory to capture data that is otherwise impossible to collect.


3. About the Researcher (Your Credibility)


About Me
I've always believed that technology can be a powerful force for good. This project is my way of putting that belief into practice—combining my professional life in AI with a deep personal connection to the natural world.

My Work in AI & Data
I enjoy building practical tools that solve real problems. My career has been about helping organizations understand and use data in meaningful ways.

As a Founding AI Engineer and former agency co-founder, I've had the chance to lead the development of custom AI agents for businesses in various industries.


I'm also fascinated by the stories data can tell. In a past role as a Data Scientist at Onex, I built dashboards to turn complex data into clear insights and used AI to improve data interpretation.



My technical skills include the tools needed to see this project through, like Python, TensorFlow, and GIS software such as ESRI ArcGIS.


Why I Hike
My passion for the outdoors has taken me to some incredible places, from multi-day treks in the Canadian Rockies and Austrian Alps to the trails of Norway.

Hiking is more than a hobby for me; it's a practice of observation and resilience.

It's this mindset—of paying close attention to the environment and working through challenges—that I will bring to this data collection effort.

For me, the Te Araroa hike is more than an adventure. It's an opportunity to use my skills in a meaningful way, contributing to the stewardship of the places that inspire me.

4. Partnership Opportunities (The Core Offering)

This is where I showcase the three tailored proposals. Structure it with clear sub-headings.




### **Partnership Opportunities**

The Trail AI Intelligence Project is a single, powerful field expedition with multiple high-value applications. We are seeking partners to transform a unique 3,000km data collection journey into actionable insights. Below are three distinct partnership tracks designed to deliver tangible returns for your organization's specific goals.

-----

### **Track A: Predictive Trail Condition and Maintenance Analytics**

[cite\_start]**Ideal For:** Trail Management Organizations (Te Araroa Trust, DOC) [cite: 735][cite\_start], GIS/Mapping Tech Companies (AllTrails, Gaia GPS, Garmin) [cite: 735][cite\_start], and "AI for Good" Programs[cite: 735].

[cite\_start]**The Concept:** This flagship project involves systematically collecting high-resolution, geotagged data on points of trail degradation—such as erosion, drainage failures, treefall, and infrastructure damage—along the entire trail [cite: 63-64, 499-500]. [cite\_start]In the post-hike phase, this dataset will be used to train a machine learning model to predict future maintenance "hotspots" [cite: 105, 502-503].

**Your Value Proposition & Deliverables:**

  * [cite\_start]**Proactive, Data-Driven Maintenance:** Move beyond reactive, anecdotal reports from hikers[cite: 505]. [cite\_start]This model will enable a proactive maintenance schedule, allowing organizations to allocate limited budgets and volunteer hours with maximum efficiency and impact[cite: 158, 505].
  * [cite\_start]**A Unique "Ground-Truth" Dataset:** For mapping companies, this project provides the most comprehensive trail condition dataset ever created for the Te Araroa[cite: 227]. [cite\_start]It can be used to validate and enrich your existing maps or create a new premium "Verified Condition" layer, enhancing user safety and planning [cite: 224, 228-229].
  * **Actionable Tools:** The final deliverable is more than just data. [cite\_start]It includes a full analytical report and an interactive "Risk Model" map that visually highlights sections of the trail most likely to degrade under specific conditions (e.g., after heavy rainfall) [cite: 132-135].

### **Track B: AI-Powered Biodiversity Monitoring**

[cite\_start]**Ideal For:** Conservation NGOs (Forest & Bird) [cite: 738][cite\_start], Corporate Sustainability Departments, and "AI for Good" Programs (Microsoft, Google)[cite: 735, 780].

[cite\_start]**The Concept:** Execute a systematic, longitudinal biodiversity survey across diverse ecosystems along the 3,000 km trail corridor[cite: 491]. [cite\_start]This involves collecting standardized, geotagged, and timestamped data—such as photos of indicator species or audio recordings of birdsong—to create a powerful conservation dataset[cite: 61, 492].

**Your Value Proposition & Deliverables:**

  * [cite\_start]**A Nationwide Biodiversity Baseline:** This project creates an invaluable dataset that can establish a baseline of species distribution along the trail corridor[cite: 495]. [cite\_start]This data can be provided to organizations like Landcare Research to validate existing models and support national conservation strategies like Predator Free 2050 [cite: 292-293, 300].
  * [cite\_start]**A Powerful CSR & "AI for Good" Story:** Partnering on this track provides a compelling, field-based case study for your corporate social responsibility or "AI for Good" program[cite: 473, 539]. [cite\_start]It's a tangible demonstration of using advanced technology to address critical environmental challenges like biodiversity loss[cite: 471].
  * [cite\_start]**High-Quality, Structured Data:** You will receive the complete, cleaned, and validated open-source dataset, ready for analysis by your own or public research teams, contributing directly to the global scientific community[cite: 258, 276].
